# How to use TypeScript to write less buggy code

This is one of three articles regarding the experiences that I gathered in the work field and during the minor web development. Some things are new to me, for example testing applications, while others, like this one I exclusively use myself and have learned at [Lifely](https://lifely.nl/).

This article focusses on the way [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/home.html) can help you to write less buggy code. You will have to test the product less, spend less time in the `debugger` and get rid of that absurd amount of `console.log()` statements.
