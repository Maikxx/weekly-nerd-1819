# Unit testing

This is one of three articles regarding the experiences that I gathered in the work field and during the minor web development. Some things are new to me, for example testing applications, which is exactly what this article is about.

This article focusses on how unit testing disproves your thoughts and implementations of the easiest appearing pieces of code in an application. I have not a lot of experience with this, so if you find something that is not completely right or could be better, feel free to shoot an issue in the repository.
